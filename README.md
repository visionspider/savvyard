<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Savvyard][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

<p>Savvyard is meant to be an aid for greenhouse monitoring. Usually smart greenhouses are automated. Meaning self-sufficient for the most part. But things don't always go right. Thats where Savvyard comes to the rescue. With Savvyard you can monitor greenhouse activities from a distance and keep that peace of mind while enjoying your life.</p>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

<div class="single-project-container"> 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgrU0RVNfMo" >  <img src="./server/assets/youtube.png" alt="Youtube Savvyard demo (turn on subtitles)" height="100%" width="100%">
</a>
  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>Personally I have a passion for off-grid living and have looked extensively into greenhouses / aquaponics / hydroponics projects of others. As someone who also enjoys traveling I would like a way to monitor my plant babies while I am gone. As a compliment to those who have such products, a nice UI that could help share information and manipulate devices while one is away (traveling / etc…). This is my goal to achieve with this UI.</p>
  <img src="./server/assets/savvyard-large3.png" alt="mobile version of project: " height="100%" width="100%">
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul><li>Being able to add/remove an infinite amount of devices/sensors/zones.</li><li>Being able to manually turn on controls on a sensor/device.</li><li>Being able to visualize data on the screen.</li><li>Being able to download data.</li></ul>

  <h3>Design</h3>
  <p>When designing I took inspiration off of apps for smart homes.</p><h3>Issues</h3>
  <p>Creating the feature of adding and removing an infinite amount of devices/sensors/zones. Working with data that is nested deep into a data set.</p>
